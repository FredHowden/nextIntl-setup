# this is my working next-intl setup.


## Features


- Works with **App Router**.
- **No prop drilling**.
- Is **dynamically routed** (`/en`, `/fr`, etc.).
- Makes **pages static** and SEO-friendly by preloading text in client components, allowing HTML only bots to read the text.


- Uses latest **next-intl** version (4.7.0).
- Uses latest **Typescript** version (5.9.3).
- Uses latest **Tailwind** version (4.1.18).
