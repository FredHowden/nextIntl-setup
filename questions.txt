Does next-intl expect all english texts to be inside a single file? 

Nextjs. Why does next-intl not just have a translation() function that decides whether to either use useTranslations or getTranslation at build time, because at the top of the file next-intl knows whether it is a client or server component and it can also check whether this is a react file?

What is the global.ts file and why does autocorrect not work without it?



answered:

Why do we need a defaultLocale if not for a fallbackLocale, but then why is it not called fallbackLocale?
answer: because sometimes people want the default language to be without the language(/en/pathname) infront of it.


Does next-intl when creating static pages place the text inside the client component code?
answer: yes, you can check this by disabeling the javascript then reloading the page. If 
there is text then the text is preloaded.
